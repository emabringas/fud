The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations
against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28,
1969, at the Stonewall Inn, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New
York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American
history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a
government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have
become the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement
in the United States and around the world.
